Interactive Visualization of the CESM-LENS2 Climate Dataset: Lessons Learned and Recommendations for Visualizing Gridded Datasets using Open Science Tools	Talk	talk-interactive-viz	"104th Annual Meeting, American Meteorological Society"	2024-01-24	"Baltimore, MD"		"Gave a talk on different approaches to interactively visualize gridded data using the CESM-LENS-2 climate dataset. Showcased two methods to let a user interact with the climate dataset and compared their features and limitations. Dashboards can be accessed here - (1) Using HoloViews: https://github.com/negin513/LENS2-Dashboard-Python, (2) Using FastAPI and D3.js: "
